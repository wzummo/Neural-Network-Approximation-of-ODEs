# Neural-Network-for-ODE-s

This project attempts to use neural networks for approximate the solution to a differential equation.

The loss function consists of the loss from the residual of the ode and the initial condition.


Concerns I would like to address:
  This takes almost 3 hours to train. 
  This requires we know the analytical solution in order to find the initial condition which seems to defeat the purpose.
